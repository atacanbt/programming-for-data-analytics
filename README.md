# Programming for Data Analytics Module Repository

This repository contains all the coursework and projects related to the Programming for Data Analytics module. The projects primarily focus on using Python for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. This repository holds assignments and projects that aim to provide a solid foundation in data analysis using Python. The projects cover key topics such as data cleaning, visualization, exploratory data analysis, and applying machine learning algorithms.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine or GitHub Codespaces.

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atacanbt/programming_for_data_analytics
cd programming_for_data_analytics
```
### 2. Set up Python environment using Conda

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   
3. Create a new Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.8
   ```

4. Activate the Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

### 3. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```

### 4. Running Jupyter Notebooks

</a>

If you want to run the Jupyter notebooks (rainfall_analysis_dublin.ipynb) where you can see my analysis on weather data:

1. Run the notebook in Visual Studio Code
2. Alternatively, you can run the notebook on web page through Google Colab by clicking on the badge above.
